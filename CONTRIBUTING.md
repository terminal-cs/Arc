This is mainly tips you should follow for all repos, but you dont have to, just for this one.

In order to contribute, your code must be clean and as fast as it can go.
NEVER leave ANY code to which you have said "it works, i wont fix it", that is a bad mentality and is not welcome in any of my projects.
Chalenge yourself to write clean code (i.e. Good variable names, self explaining function names, etc...)
Question why things are written a certain way, dont just build on top of be before making sure it is very good quality, because the more you build on top of something, the harder it gets to change it later.
