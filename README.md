### What is arc?
Arc is a custom file format loader that is super basic and fast. It is a general format and can be used just about anywhere. From a server storing player information to a game client saving settings.
## Can I use it in my project?
Of course! just be sure to give me credit somewhere, because just taking isn't very nice.
